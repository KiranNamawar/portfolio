An elegant and intuitive weather dashboard that provides comprehensive weather information with beautiful visualizations. Built with Vue.js and D3.js, this application offers real-time weather data, forecasts, and interactive maps.

## Features

### Current Weather

- Real-time weather conditions
- Temperature, humidity, and pressure readings
- Wind speed and direction
- UV index and visibility
- Sunrise and sunset times

### Weather Forecasts

- 7-day weather forecast
- Hourly predictions for next 24 hours
- Weather trend analysis
- Precipitation probability

### Interactive Visualizations

- Temperature charts with D3.js
- Precipitation radar maps
- Wind direction indicators
- Pressure trend graphs

### Location Services

- GPS-based location detection
- City search functionality
- Multiple location management
- Weather alerts and warnings

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Framework

- **Vue.js 3** with Composition API
- **TypeScript** for enhanced development
- **Pinia** for state management
- **Vue Router** for navigation

### Data Visualization

- **D3.js** for custom charts and graphs
- **Chart.js** for standard chart components
- **Leaflet** for interactive maps
- **SCSS** for advanced styling

### APIs and Services

- **OpenWeather API** for weather data
- **Mapbox** for map services
- **Geolocation API** for location services

## Code Architecture

```javascript
// Weather service using Composition API
export function useWeather() {
	const weatherData = ref(null);
	const loading = ref(false);
	const error = ref(null);

	const fetchWeather = async (lat, lon) => {
		loading.value = true;
		try {
			const response = await weatherAPI.getCurrent(lat, lon);
			weatherData.value = response.data;
		} catch (err) {
			error.value = err.message;
		} finally {
			loading.value = false;
		}
	};

	return {
		weatherData,
		loading,
		error,
		fetchWeather
	};
}
```

## Data Visualization Examples

### Temperature Trends

Custom D3.js line charts showing temperature variations over time with smooth animations and interactive tooltips.

### Precipitation Maps

Layered weather maps displaying precipitation intensity with color-coded overlays and zoom functionality.

### Wind Patterns

Animated wind direction indicators and speed visualizations using SVG and CSS animations.

## Performance Features

- **Lazy loading** for weather components
- **Caching** of weather data to reduce API calls
- **Progressive Web App** capabilities
- **Offline mode** with cached data
- **Responsive design** for all devices
