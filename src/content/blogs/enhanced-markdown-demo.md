# Enhanced Markdown Styling Demo

Welcome to our enhanced markdown styling system! This post demonstrates the rich typography and interactive components available for creating beautiful blog posts and project documentation.

<div class="lead">
This is a lead paragraph that stands out with larger text and enhanced styling. Use this for important introductory content that you want to emphasize.
</div>

## Typography Hierarchy

Our typography system provides a clear visual hierarchy with beautiful serif headings and readable body text.

### Level 3 Heading with Accent

This heading includes a subtle accent line that helps break up content sections visually.

#### Level 4 Heading in Primary Color

Level 4 headings use the primary color to maintain hierarchy while adding visual interest.

##### Level 5 Heading - Uppercase Style

This heading style uses uppercase letters for emphasis.

###### Level 6 Heading - Subtle

The smallest heading level with muted styling.

## Enhanced Text Elements

Regular paragraphs have comfortable line spacing and readable typography. You can use **bold text** for emphasis, _italic text_ for subtle emphasis, and `inline code` for technical terms.

Here's a paragraph with various text styling options:

- **Bold text** for strong emphasis
- _Italic text_ for subtle emphasis
- **_Bold and italic_** for maximum emphasis
- `Inline code` with syntax highlighting
- ~~Strikethrough text~~ for corrections
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> for keyboard shortcuts

External links automatically get an indicator: [Visit the Svelte documentation](https://svelte.dev) while internal links remain clean: [Back to blog](/blog).

## Interactive Callout Components

Use callouts to highlight important information with different semantic meanings:

<Callout type="info" title="Information">
This is an informational callout that provides helpful context or additional details about the content.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Important Warning">
Warning callouts draw attention to important considerations or potential issues that readers should be aware of.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error" title="Critical Error">
Error callouts highlight problems, mistakes, or critical issues that need immediate attention.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success" title="Success Story">
Success callouts celebrate achievements, completed tasks, or positive outcomes.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Quick Note">
This is an informational note callout that provides additional context or details about the content.

You can include multiple lines of content, lists, and even other markdown elements within callouts.
</Callout>

## Enhanced Code Blocks

Our code blocks support syntax highlighting and beautiful styling:

```typescript
// src/lib/utils/example.ts - TypeScript Example
interface BlogPost {
	title: string;
	description: string;
	date: string;
	tags: string[];
	published: boolean;
}

export function formatBlogPost(post: BlogPost): string {
	const formattedDate = new Date(post.date).toLocaleDateString();
	return `${post.title} - Published on ${formattedDate}`;
}
```

```css
/* CSS with Custom Properties */
.prose {
	color: var(--color-text-secondary);
	max-width: 75ch;
	font-size: var(--font-size-base);
	line-height: var(--line-height-relaxed);
}

.prose h1 {
	background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--color-text-primary), var(--primary-600));
	background-clip: text;
	-webkit-background-clip: text;
	-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
}
```

## Enhanced Images

Images now support lazy loading, zoom functionality, and enhanced captions:

<Image 
  src="/project-placeholder.svg" 
  alt="Placeholder image demonstration" 
  caption="This image demonstrates the enhanced image component with zoom functionality and copy URL feature"
  zoomable="true"
/>

## Beautiful Lists

### Unordered Lists

- **Enhanced bullet points** with custom styling
- **Nested lists** are supported:
  - Secondary level items
  - With consistent spacing
  - And visual hierarchy
- **Mixed content** including `code snippets`
- Links and [text formatting](/) work seamlessly

### Ordered Lists

1. **First item** with enhanced numbering
2. **Second item** with proper spacing
3. **Nested ordered lists** work too:
   1. Sub-item one
   2. Sub-item two
   3. Sub-item three
4. **Final item** maintains consistency

### Task Lists

- [x] Completed task with checkmark
