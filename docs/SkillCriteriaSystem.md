## Implementation Guidelines

### Self-Assessment Process

1. **Honest Evaluation**: Assess skills based on actual experience and capabilities, not aspirational goals
2. **Evidence-Based**: Each level should be supported by concrete examples and experiences
3. **Regular Updates**: Skills should be reassessed periodically as experience grows
4. **Growth Planning**: Identify specific areas for improvement and create learning plans

### Skill Progression Tracking

- Document specific projects and achievements for each skill level
- Maintain a portfolio of work that demonstrates proficiency
- Seek feedback from peers and mentors
- Engage in continuous learning and skill development

### Display Recommendations

- Show current level with clear criteria reference
- Include brief examples or achievements for higher-level skills
- Provide growth trajectory or learning plans for developing areas
- Use visual indicators that clearly communicate competency without false precision

## Conclusion

This skill criteria system provides a framework for meaningful self-assessment and professional development. It emphasizes practical capabilities over arbitrary ratings and provides clear pathways for skill advancement. Regular evaluation using these criteria supports continuous growth and realistic professional positioning.
